## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES

### Critical (Blocking Core Functionality)
1. **FIXED** ✅ - Finish Quiz button syntax error (was in quizzes.html line 16)
2. **Safari Energy Warning** ⚠️ - Expected behavior, recommend Chrome/Edge for Web LLM

### High Priority (User Experience)
1. **Courses/Notes/Cheatsheets** - Backend CRUD operations not implemented
2. **Quiz Generation Token Limit** - Currently limited to ~5 questions max due to model output size
   - Workaround: Shortened prompts, increased max_tokens to 12000
   - User must generate 5 or fewer questions

### Medium Priority (Polish)
1. **Web LLM Initialization** - Takes 2-10 seconds on page load (expected, model loading)
2. **No persistence between pages** - Each page creates new quiz engine instance
3. **Error messages** - Could be more user-friendly in some cases

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Quiz export** - No way to export quiz results
2. **Offline mode** - Only Web LLM works offline, other features need implementation
3. **Mobile optimization** - Works but could be improved

## 🎓 RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Production Use NOW
1. ✅ Use the **Focus Timer** - fully ready
2. ✅ Use **AI Quizzes** - excellent for study/test prep
3. ✅ Use **Profile & Stats** - track your progress
4. ⚠️ Skip Courses/Notes/Cheatsheets for now - not functional

### For Development Priority
1. **High:** Complete Courses/Notes/Cheatsheets CRUD operations
2. **Medium:** Add quiz export functionality
3. **Low:** Mobile app packaging (Tauri files already exist)

### For Best User Experience
1. **Use Chrome or Brave browser** - best Web LLM performance
2. **Generate 5 or fewer questions** - avoids token limits
3. **Wait 10 seconds after page load** - let Web LLM initialize
4. **Keep notes under 800 characters** - better quiz quality
