**Sample long note content:**
```
Cellular respiration is the process by which cells break down glucose to produce ATP. It occurs in three stages: glycolysis (in the cytoplasm), the Krebs cycle (in the mitochondrial matrix), and the electron transport chain (in the inner mitochondrial membrane). Glycolysis breaks down one glucose molecule into two pyruvate molecules, producing 2 ATP and 2 NADH. The Krebs cycle processes pyruvate to produce CO2, ATP, NADH, and FADH2. Finally, the electron transport chain uses NADH and FADH2 to create a proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis, producing approximately 34 ATP molecules.
```
