# Photosynthesis Study Notes

## Overview
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. This process occurs primarily in the chloroplasts of plant cells.

## The Photosynthesis Equation
The overall chemical equation for photosynthesis is:
**6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂**

This means that carbon dioxide and water, in the presence of light energy, produce glucose and oxygen.

## Two Main Stages

### Light-Dependent Reactions (Light Reactions)
- Occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts
- Require sunlight to function
- Water molecules are split (photolysis) releasing oxygen as a byproduct
- Produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH
- Chlorophyll absorbs light energy, primarily in the red and blue wavelengths

### Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle)
- Also called the "dark reactions" (though they don't require darkness)
- Occur in the stroma of chloroplasts
- Use ATP and NADPH from light reactions
- Fix carbon dioxide into organic molecules
- Produce glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) through a series of steps

## Key Definitions

**Chlorophyll** is the green pigment in plants that absorbs light energy for photosynthesis.

**Stomata** are small pores on the underside of leaves that allow CO₂ to enter and O₂ to exit.

**Thylakoid** refers to the membrane-bound compartments inside chloroplasts where light reactions occur.

**Stroma** is the fluid-filled space surrounding the thylakoids where the Calvin Cycle takes place.

## Important Facts
- Photosynthesis is responsible for producing most of Earth's oxygen
- Plants appear green because chlorophyll reflects green light while absorbing red and blue
- The Calvin Cycle is named after Melvin Calvin who discovered it in 1950
- Without photosynthesis, most life on Earth would not be possible
- Temperature, light intensity, and CO₂ concentration all affect the rate of photosynthesis

## Factors Affecting Photosynthesis Rate
1. **Light Intensity**: More light = faster rate (up to a point)
2. **Carbon Dioxide Concentration**: Higher CO₂ = faster rate (up to saturation)
3. **Temperature**: Optimal around 25-35°C for most plants
4. **Water Availability**: Essential but rarely limiting under normal conditions
5. **Chlorophyll Content**: More chlorophyll = more light absorption
